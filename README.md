# **📌 Multiple Linear Regression Project**

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Multiple Linear Regression** model using Python.
The repository includes all steps along with screenshots of code, outputs, and visualizations.

## **📃 What’s Included**

* Dataset loading & preprocessing
* Feature selection for multiple regression
* Train–test split
* Model training using `LinearRegression`
* Coefficients & intercept extraction
* Model evaluation (R², MAE, MSE, RMSE)
* **Matplotlib scatter plots** for:

  * Actual vs Predicted comparison
  * Relationship between features & target

## **📊 Visualizations**

* Scatter plots to show linear relationships
* Residual analysis
* Trend lines for prediction visualization

## **🛠️ Tech Used**

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Google Colab

## **🎯 Objective**

To understand how multiple features together influence a target variable and how a Multiple Linear Regression model performs on real data.
